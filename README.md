# Full-Application-of-Fortran-to-do-numerical-simulation
1. The video description about this repository is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqKlzVAXyHc&t=9s 
2. Read the data file from "Reaction_rate_constant.txt"
3. Conduct numerical simulation
4. Write the results
5. Real-world model could be really big and complicated, but it starts from small files
